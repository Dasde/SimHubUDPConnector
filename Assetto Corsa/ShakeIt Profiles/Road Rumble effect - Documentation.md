# Road Rumble effect #
The Road Rumble effect is a 4-corner ShakeIt effect.
It uses the realtime surface type and vibration by wheel data from assetto corsa.
The profile requires the SimHubUDPConnector lua app with RoadRumbleExtension activated (activated by default) and the SimHubUDPConnector.dll SimHub plugin.
> [!NOTE]
> The new version of the effect enables dynamic frequencies. It requires the WheelExtension activated (not activated by default).
It's a group of effects, that includes one effect per surface type so make sure to adjust the effect for each surface type (intensity, frequencies...) to get the best result for your setup.
